  ☐ Users can write CSS in separate "sandbox window" (will automatically import into JS sandbox and execute alongside said code)
  ☐ Error viewport/notifications (for bundled code)

  UTILS/PLUGINS:
    ☐ Encrypt "#source" script code (i.e. the "id" of the script tag?) in 'iframe-html.ts' → best solution: OBFUSCATION and/or MINIFICATION
