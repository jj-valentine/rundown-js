# CLI for In-Browser IDE: Code Snippet + Documentation Generator

Create JavaScript snippets. Run your code. Take notes in markdown. Rinse and repeat. 

## The *What* and The *Why*...
  - With **RundownJS**'s web-based IDE, you can *import* packages/modules, *transpile*, *bundle*, and *run* your JavaScript code -- all within the browser, at blazing fast speeds, and without ever making a single server-side request! 

  - Do your snippets need context? Go full "rundown" -- document your JavaSript using markdown, then group and export your notated snippets for reference and later use!
