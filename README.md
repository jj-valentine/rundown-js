# CLI for In-Browser IDE: Code Snippet + Documentation Generator

Write code snippets. Run code snippets. Take notes. Combine and export them!

## The *What* and The *Why*...
  - With **SnipSnap's** web-based IDE, you can *transpile* your JavaScript, *import modules*, *bundle it together* and *run it* -- all without making any server-side requests! 

  - Do your snippets need context? Document your code in markdown and attach your notes to your snippets to reference later or use elsewhere!
