# CLI for In-Browser IDE: Code Snippet + Documentation Generator
Write code snippets. Run code snippets. Take notes. Combine, and export them! 

With SnipSnap's web-based IDE, you can transpile your JavaScript, import modules, bundle it together and run it -- all without making any server-side requests! 
Do your snippets need context? Document your code in markdown and attach your notes to your snippets to reference later, or even use elsewhere!
